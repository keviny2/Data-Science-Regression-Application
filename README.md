# Regression Application
A Python GUI app developed using PyQt5 software. Uses statsmodels to perform different types of regressions such as Linear, Logistic, Polynomial, and ElasticNet from a user inputted .csv or .xlsx file and matplotlib to visualize the regression by plotting the data and regression line. Prior to performing the regression, the incoming raw data is preprocessed so that the regression can continue without errors. User friendly UI that is easy to use and pleasant to look at.
